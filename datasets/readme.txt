In this folder, we have a set of validation data to see whether our C implementation is correct. The ".npy" files are the orginal dataset generated by "numpy", a python math package. To load data into our C program, we need to turn it to txt file. The python file "npy_to_txt.py" is used for this. We wrote a "npy_to_txt.sh" which calls the python file, simply run "./npy_to_txt.sh", and the result is corresponding txt fil.


org_seq: a dataset contains 1000 sequences, each with a length of 50. shape: (1000, 50)

rnn_result: the result generated by Keras, we will compare this result with our C implementation, to verify the correctness. shape: (1000, )

actual_result: the actual next word in the dataset. Only for reference, but won't use in our programs. shape: (1000, )

To load these datasets, a template file is "load_sequence.c"
	gcc -o a.out load_sequence.c
	./a.out
