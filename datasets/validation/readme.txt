org_seq: a dataset contains 1000 sequences, each with a length of 50. shape: (1000, 50)

rnn_result: the result generated by Keras, we will compare this result with our C implementation, to verify the correctness.

actual_result: the actual next word in the dataset. Only for reference, but won't use in our programs
