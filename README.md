# C-implementation-of-RNN

## Introduction
This is the first step to implement RNN on FPGAs. All modules are heavily commented. We will use High-Level Synthesis to turn these code into Hardware Description Languages (HDL).

## Module Description
rnn.c: RNN Layers

fc.c: Fully-connected Layers 

softmax.c: Softmax Layers
